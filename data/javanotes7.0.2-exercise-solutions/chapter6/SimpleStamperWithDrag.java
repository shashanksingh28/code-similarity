/**
 * A simple demonstration of MouseEvents.  Shapes are drawn
 * on a black background when the user clicks the panel.  If
 * the user Shift-clicks, the panel is cleared.  If the user
 * right-clicks the panel, a blue oval is drawn.  Otherwise,
 * when the user clicks, a red rectangle is drawn.  The contents of
 * the panel are not persistent.  For example, they might disappear 
 * if the panel is resized or is covered and uncovered.
 * Ovals and rects continue to be drawn as the user drags the mouse.
 * This class has a main() routine to allow it to be run as an application.
