/**
 * This program uses a probabilistic technique to estimate the
 * value of the mathematical constant pi.  The technique is to
 * choose random numbers x and y in the range 0 to 1, and to
 * compute x*x + y*y.  The probability that x*x + y*y is less than
 * 1 is pi/4.  If many trials are performed, and the number of
 * trials in which x*x+y*y is less than 1 is divided by the total
 * number of trials, the result is an approximation for pi/4.
 * Multiplying this by 4 gives an approximation for pi.
 * 
 * The program shows the estimate produced by this procedure, along
 * with the number of trials that have been done and, for comparison,
 * the actual value of pi.  These values are shown in three JLabels.
 * The computation is done by several separate threads.  Periodically,
 * these threads place their results into a queue.  Another thread,
 * the event-handling thread in a method called by a Timer, removes
 * results from the queue and applies them to the labels every
 * 1/10 second.
 * 
 * In this version of the program, there is a "Run"/"Pause" button
 * that controls the computation threads.  Clicking the button once
 * starts the threads; clicking it again pauses them.  Initially, the
 * threads are paused.
