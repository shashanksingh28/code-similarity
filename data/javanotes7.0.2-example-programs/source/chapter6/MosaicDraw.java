/**
 * A MosaicDraw is a JFrame that shows a MosaicPanel as its content pane.  The mosaic
 * is made up of rows and columns of squares.  The user can click-and-drag
 * the mouse to color the squares.  A menu bar with some options is shown
 * at the top of the window.  The window will be centered on the screen,
 * but will not be visible initially.
 * 
 * This class also contains a main program, so that it can be run as a
 * stand-alone application.  The main program creates a MosaicDrawFrame and
 * makes it visible on the screen.  It also sets the program to end when
 * the user closes the window.
 * 
 * Note that this class depends on MosaicPanel.java and MosaicDrawController.java.
