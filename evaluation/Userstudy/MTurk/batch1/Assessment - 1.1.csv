1. Navigation is a bit fuzzy. By reading the instructions and clicking start ""HERE"" link, I was directed to FAQs instead of Problem 1. On clicking Problem 1, a message comes to solve other problem first. 
2. I assume that the recommendations are used to solve the problem. There were times when I needed an answer regarding syntax but I coudn't get a recommendation since syntax has to be right.
3. During problem solving, usually there are questions like ""how to sort an array using a library"", there seems to be no way to get recommendations for these questions. Writing in comments about this is similar to googling.
4. Points 2 and 3 are listed only because the user is forced to give 15 recommendations. With the given problems and I, after getting a few recommendations, I was forced to find the other recommendations and sometimes mark even if they were irrelevant. IMPORTANT: Some recommendations (3-4) were very pretty accurate 5/5 but rest were not related. Those 3-4 recommendations were enough to solve problem but I had to forcefully select other irrelevant recommendations. "

Seems to work OK when searching for general algorithms, but falls a bit short on specific structures. Interesting concept nonetheless.
