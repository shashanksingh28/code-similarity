1. Navigation is a bit fuzzy. By reading the instructions and clicking start ""HERE"" link, I was directed to FAQs instead of Problem 1. On clicking Problem 1, a message comes to solve other problem first. 
2. I assume that the recommendations are used to solve the problem. There were times when I needed an answer regarding syntax but I coudn't get a recommendation since syntax has to be right.
3. During problem solving, usually there are questions like ""how to sort an array using a library"", there seems to be no way to get recommendations for these questions. Writing in comments about this is similar to googling.
4. Points 2 and 3 are listed only because the user is forced to give 15 recommendations. With the given problems and I, after getting a few recommendations, I was forced to find the other recommendations and sometimes mark even if they were irrelevant. IMPORTANT: Some recommendations (3-4) were very pretty accurate 5/5 but rest were not related. Those 3-4 recommendations were enough to solve problem but I had to forcefully select other irrelevant recommendations. "

Secondly, some of your recommendations were completely irrelevant (i.e. what is the point of recommending a method with paintComponent in a question on array differences?). 

Overall the idea is fabulous, however textual hints or points might help better for beginning programmers compared to actual code that your system was recommending. This is because, for a beginning programmer, reading recommended code in itself becomes an exercise. You can try putting shorter more relevant 'hint' kind of features compared to such larger chunks of code being recommended.

Best of luck with your IDE and idea. 

-Bye."
